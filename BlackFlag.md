## Summary

It starts out with a low ranking pirate named Edward D whose dream is to become the best feared pirate. Edwards later finds himself learning the secret techniques of assassin’s order and with that knowledge he works his way up by getting a ship of his own and recruiting any men for his crew. Edward also travels the seas and finds little islands that might have treasure hidden or hunting wild animals and vicious sharks.

On the journey to the sea Eward must honor what he has been taught by hunting down targets that the order has assigned him. It will take time to find them all and he’s also a wanted man because he’s a pirate who aboard cargo ships and destroying any law ships that want him to hang.   

## Final Thoughts
Assassin’s Creed IV Black flag is an awesome game to play when you're looking for the experience of a pirate. In the beginning the equipment is low of course but it will get better concerning other ships for their supplies. To work the ship there are four settings for the speed, then you have your fire power like the cannons, mini barrel shooters, and the front cannon chain. Also you can upgrade the ship to have better wood to take less damage and the front ram to hit other ships.
